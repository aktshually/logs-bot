# Logs Bot
This is a simple Discord bot, wich can register logs from your server by sending messages in some specific channel wich can be always changed. I couldn't let it online because of some problems with the host that I use so, if you who is reading would like to inspire your project on this code or even use it, you are allowed to. If you want to do some change, please, open a issue on this repository and say what you would like to change and why, certainly I will anwer as soon as I can. Also, you can freely modify the folders structure.

**Aditional note** <br>
If you want to use all the code provided on this repository, give the credits to this github page (about the token, don't worry, it has been reseted some time ago).
